How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
   With creating user stories one must carefully listen to what the users problem is and what is a possible solution.
   Creating a user story helps because you need a detailed user statement about the action and when writing the story you have to think 
   about the acceptance to make sure it meets the users needs and solves their problem. When creating a user story one can also consider if
   its possible to finish it in one sprint or does it need to be broken into parts.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
   I approach developing a program by identifying the problem i am trying to solvea and wrtiting a design document, this helps get my ideas 
   on paper and the design started. Then, start identifying how the programs basic funtions are going to work and start some pseudocode. After,
   code and debug. I have not worked in a team yet so the agile processes i would like to see or incorporate in the future is a variation of scrum 
   and the use of project management tools.
